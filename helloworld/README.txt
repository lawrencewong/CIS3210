This is the readme file for my application for the computer networking course.
As of right now it is a simple web page that uses jquery and javascript to animate
Links The Cat to do various things through the use of the three buttons provided!

In the root directory start the service by entering the command:

paster serve --reload development.ini

Go to this address in your web browser.
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Using the buttons play with Links the Cat!
